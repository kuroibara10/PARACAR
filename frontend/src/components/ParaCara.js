          A ParaCare is a type of retail store that specializes in offering a
          wide variety of health, beauty, and wellness products. Unlike
          traditional pharmacies, parapharmacies do not sell prescription
          medications. Instead, they focus on over-the-counter items, personal
          care products, and other goods aimed at improving your well-being.
